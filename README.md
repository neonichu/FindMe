## FindMe

Two simple scripts which allow you to keep an updated log of your location 
in a Gist. It utilizes [rosumi][1] for getting your location from Apple's
[Find My iPhone][2] service. Through GitHub's [GeoJSON][3] support in Gists,
you can then share your current location on your website ([example][4]).
